        <h4>Q. What is a Pole Fitness Class?</h4>
        <p>A. A Pole Fitness class is a great way to build strength and flexibility as well as gain self-confidence! We incorporate dance moves, cardio workouts, stretching, pole tricks and more to give you a good workout, while having fun!</p>

        <h4>Q. What is the best way to sign up for a class?</h4>
        <p>A. The best way to sign up for a class is to sing up for a MindBody Account. Visit https://clients.mindbodyonline.com then search for Fort Wayne Aerial and make your payment and get registered! </p>
        
        <h4>Q. Can my boyfriend come watch?</h4>
        <p>A. Not unless he is a student too! Pole class isn’t ‘cute’, and it’s not a show. We have many women who come in here and work hard, and we don’t want them feeling uncomfortable having a stranger watch!</p>

        <h4>Q. I don’t have any dance experience, can I still join?</h4>
        <p>A. Yes! We are excited to share the world of pole dancing with everyone! Our multilevel program will allow you to progress at your own pace!</p>

        <h4>Q. What should I bring to my first class?</h4>
        <p>A. Water, workout clothes, and a lot of energy! ..Oh! And your state ID.</p>

        <h4>Q. Where are your classes located?</h4>
        <p>A. We are currently offering classes at the Westland Mall off of Getz Road</p>

        <h4>Q. How big are your classes?</h4>
        <p>A. We have just moved to a larger studio space and will take up to 6 or 8 students per class depending on the content that will be covered. We try to keep class ratios low. It is important to us to keep our classes intimate for our students.</p>

        <h4>Q. What kind of workout clothes should I wear?</h4>
        <p>A. Some girls wear yoga pants to class, others wear booty shorts! Whatever you are comfortable in will work best for you. The further you progress in pole the smaller your clothes will get! Your exposed skin will help you stick to the pole!</p>

        <h4>Q. Can I start after I lose 10lbs?</h4>
        <p>A. There is no need to wait! Pole dancing is great for men and women of all sizes! You won’t be flipping upside down for a while, and there are plenty of moves to do before your feet ever have to leave the ground! These moves will not only help you build strength for more advanced pole moves, but can also get you more excited to exercise regularly outside of pole so you can progress quicker!</p>

        <h4>Q. Do I need heels?</h4>
        <p>A. No. Students will be required to dance in bare feet. As you become more comfortable with pole dancing, with instructor permission, you can start to bring your shoes for the ‘Free Expressions’ dance portion of class.</p>

        <h4>Q. I have some great heels I wore out to the club last weekend, can I use them?</h4>
        <p>A. Unfortunately we do not allow ‘street shoes’ to be worn in the studio! But if you get a pair just for pole dancing you are welcome to bring them!</p>

        <h4>Q. I want to come in for a class and learn to Pole Dance so I can be a stripper, when is that class?</h4>
        <p>A. Pole dancing is not something you can learn in one class. We do not have a class specifically for ‘Dancers’ at this time, but you’re more than welcome to come join our regular class or you can book a private lesson for more one on one help!</p>

        <h4>Q. I am having trouble sticking to the pole when I come to class, why?! I swear it’s the weather!</h4>
        <p>A. MANY things can influence this, including the weather!! Most of the time issue can be solved if you make sure you do NOT use lotion for up to 6 hours before your class. Tanning lotion included! But, some days your body just does not want to stick to the pole! It happens.</p>

        <h4>Q. Are all of your students young and skinny?</h4>
        <p>A. Not at all!!! Most of our students are between 25 and 35. We have all shapes and sizes here; everyone is welcome and encouraged to join!!</p>

        <h4>I have additional questions about classes or parties. How do I get these answered?</h4>
        <p>A. E-mail us at fwadance@gmail.com with either CLASSES or PARTY in the subject line and we will reply with all the details as soon as possible!</p>
